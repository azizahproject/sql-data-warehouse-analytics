# 📊 Data Analytics Project


This project is a **continuation of the Data Warehouse development** from the *DataWithBaraa* YouTube course.  
In the previous phase, I built the **ETL pipeline** and successfully produced clean, standardized, and analytics-ready tables in the **Gold Layer**:

- `gold.dim_customer` — Customer dimension table  
- `gold.dim_product` — Product dimension table  
- `gold.fact_sales` — Sales fact table  

The focus of this phase is **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand key business measures and derive insights from the cleaned dataset.

## 🎯 Objectives

The purpose of this analysis is to:

- Calculate core business metrics (e.g., total sales, revenue, customer count).
- Understand product performance and customer activity.
- Prepare metric outputs in a structured form for dashboarding or further analytics.
- Validate that the Gold Layer is **not only clean**, but also **useful for decision-making**.
